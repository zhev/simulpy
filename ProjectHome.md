This project try to create a new platform of simulation and design based primary on blocks diagrams. It will be write on python, with a gtk ui, designed with glade.

A first architecture has a core system that will perform all the mathematical part, it also has a library-repository that handle all the blocks and the code of each of them, and finally the ui interface.
